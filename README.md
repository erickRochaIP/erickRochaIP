My name is Erick Figueirôa Rocha, nice to meet you 😎  
I am currently studying computer engineering at CEFET 💻  
I am interested in learning more about the various fields of computing and making a positive impact with my work 👍  
Maybe someday I'll contribute in a open source project... I hope!  
Feel free to look at my repositories to see what kind of thing I've been doing in the last years 🎣
